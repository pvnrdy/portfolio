        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Pavan Kumar Reddy, a passionate and experienced full stack developer. With a strong background in
            both
            front-end and back-end development, I strive to create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly web
            applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey in SaaS applications development began 4 years ago, and I've been hooked ever since. I have extensive
            knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the back end, I'm comfortable working with Java and have
            experience with
            MySQL database.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, ranging from building robust
            customer experience platforms to developing custom web applications. I enjoy taking on challenges and
            solving complex
            problems, and I'm constantly learning and keeping up with the latest technologies and best practices in the
            field.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a full stack developer, I believe in the importance of creating seamless experiences for users. I have a
            keen eye for design and focus on crafting responsive and intuitive interfaces. I also value collaboration
            and effective communication, working closely with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, binge eating in restaurants, or
            playing badminton.
